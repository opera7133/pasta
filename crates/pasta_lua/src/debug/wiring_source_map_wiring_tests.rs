//! Task 4.2 — the gating that decides whether the I/O-side `.pasta` consumers
//! (resolver 5.2 / BP translation 5.3) are reached. `pasta_active()` is the
//! single gate: a map present AND `SourceMode::Pasta` (design 582). Otherwise
//! the bridge keeps its default `.lua` behavior (requirements 6.1/6.2/7.2).
