//! `BreakpointSet`: the shared breakpoint store with a **two-tier key** —
//! present source (DAP retain/replace key) + resolved execution coordinate
//! `(chunk, lua_line)` (stop-decision key). (design "BpTranslator 二段キー"
//! 516-528, requirements 4.4 / 8.2.)
//!
//! # Shared, settable-during-execution store (design "System Flows" main 判断)
//!
//! Breakpoints must be settable *while the VM is executing*: the design states
//! "`setBreakpoints` のみ実行中でも可（`Arc<Mutex>` 共有）". [`BreakpointSet`] is
//! therefore a `#[derive(Clone)]` newtype over
//! [`Arc`]`<`[`Mutex`](std::sync::Mutex)`<`[`HashSet`]`<`[`Breakpoint`]`>>>`: the
//! VM-thread hook holds one clone and reads via [`BreakpointSet::should_pause`],
//! while the controller / transport thread holds another clone and writes via
//! [`BreakpointSet::set_breakpoints`]. Cloning is cheap (an `Arc` bump) and all
//! clones share the same inner set, so an update made on one handle is observed
//! by every other handle (this is what makes "set during execution" work). The
//! same shared `Arc` is what makes registered breakpoints **persist across the
//! short-lived multi-request debug sessions** of requirement 4.4.
//!
//! # Lock discipline (hook must never block while holding the lock)
//!
//! [`should_pause`](BreakpointSet::should_pause) is a quick lock / check /
//! unlock: it takes the mutex, runs the containment predicate, and drops the
//! guard before returning. The hook MUST NOT hold this lock across a blocking
//! stop (the blocking stop is task 2.2's `block_until_command`, which runs
//! *after* `should_pause` has already returned and released the lock).
//!
//! # Two-tier resolution semantics (the heart of this module)
//!
//! A [`Breakpoint`] carries two independent keys (design 519-524):
//!
//! - **present source** ([`Breakpoint::present_source`]) — the source path the
//!   IDE presented the breakpoint under (`.pasta` or `.lua`). This is the
//!   **retain / replace key**.
//!   [`set_breakpoints`](BreakpointSet::set_breakpoints) REPLACES the
//!   breakpoints whose `present_source` matches the request's source — and ONLY
//!   those (matching DAP semantics, where each `setBreakpoints` call is
//!   authoritative for the source it names). Breakpoints presented under any
//!   OTHER source are preserved **even if they resolve into the same chunk**
//!   (requirement 4.4: registered BPs persist; requirement 8.2: a `.pasta`- and
//!   a `.lua`-origin BP in one chunk never mutually evict).
//! - **execution coordinate** (`chunk` + `lua_line`) — the resolved `.lua`
//!   position the runtime hook actually reaches. This is the
//!   **stop-decision key**. The hook reports the executing chunk source + line
//!   and [`should_pause`](BreakpointSet::should_pause) matches against
//!   `(chunk, lua_line)`; the presented space is irrelevant to whether we stop.
//!
//! For the existing `.lua` path both tiers collapse to the same `.lua` identity
//! (the caller sets `present_source == chunk ==` the DAP `.lua` source path), so
//! the prior single-key behaviour is preserved byte-for-byte. The `.pasta`
//! translation that populates `present_source = .pasta` with a distinct
//! `chunk`/`lua_line` is task 5.3.
//!
//! [`set_breakpoints`](BreakpointSet::set_breakpoints) returns the resolved
//! breakpoints as `Vec<`[`ResolvedBreakpoint`]`>`, each `verified: true` —
//! Lua-level lines are accepted as-is in this spec; verification refinement
//! (binding to an executable location) is out of scope here.
