//! Transport: TCP listener + DAP-compliant Content-Length framing on an
//! I/O-ONLY thread (design "Transport & DapAdapter", requirements 3.1 / 5.5).
//!
//! # Role in the backend
//!
//! [`Transport`] is the wire layer of the debug backend. It owns a long-lived
//! listener thread (promoted from the PoC `transport_loop::serve`) that:
//!
//! 1. binds a [`TcpListener`] to the configured address (ONLY when debugging is
//!    enabled — `listen == None` opens nothing, R5.5),
//! 2. accepts exactly ONE client connection (single-client by design),
//! 3. bridges that socket to two `std::sync::mpsc` channels, reading framed JSON
//!    from the socket into an inbound channel and writing outbound JSON from a
//!    channel back to the socket.
//!
//! Unlike the PoC, which used a bare line protocol (`stopped <src> <line>\n`),
//! production uses **DAP-compliant `Content-Length` framing** (design
//! "Transport": "PoC の素朴な行プロトコルは DAP 準拠フレーミングへ作り直す").
//!
//! # I/O ONLY — never touches Lua (design "Transport"/"Architecture")
//!
//! The transport thread uses only `std::net` / `std::io` / `std::sync::mpsc` and
//! the existing `serde_json`. It MUST NOT touch `mlua::Lua` / Lua state: the
//! `mlua::Lua` handle is `!Send` and is pinned to the VM thread. The only seam
//! the transport exposes is a pair of channels carrying raw
//! [`serde_json::Value`] frames; DAP message SEMANTICS (initialize /
//! setBreakpoints / …) are owned by the DAP adapter (task 3.2), NOT here. This
//! layer is purely the byte/JSON wire boundary.
//!
//! # Wire frame: `Content-Length: <N>\r\n\r\n<json>` (byte length)
//!
//! A frame is a header block terminated by a blank line (`\r\n\r\n`) followed by
//! exactly `N` bytes of UTF-8 JSON body, where `N` is the **byte** length of the
//! body (NOT its char count — multi-byte UTF-8 such as Japanese makes the two
//! differ). Reads are robust to extra/reordered headers; only `Content-Length`
//! is significant. See [`read_frame`] / [`write_frame`].
//!
//! # Clean shutdown (no hang on EOF / disconnect)
//!
//! The listener thread returns safely on socket EOF, an I/O error, or channel
//! disconnect (the inbound `Sender` being dropped, or the outbound `Receiver`
//! being dropped) — mirroring the PoC's "safe return on error" so the thread
//! never hangs. [`Transport::shutdown`] drops the outbound sender and unblocks
//! the writer; the reader unblocks on the next socket EOF / error. Tests use a
//! TEST-ONLY `set_read_timeout` and bounded joins so CI cannot hang; the
//! production path has no timeout baked in.
//!
//! # Module layout (C3 directory module)
//!
//! This hub holds the [`Transport`] type, its impls, [`Drop`], and the listener
//! thread body [`serve`]. The frame codec (Content-Length framing) lives in the
//! [`framing`] submodule and is re-exported here so the wire-level seam reads as
//! a single `transport` surface (`read_frame` / `write_frame`).
