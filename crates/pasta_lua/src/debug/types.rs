//! Shared, DAP-independent debug data types (DTOs) for the debug backend.
//!
//! These plain data types are promoted from the validated PoC harness
//! (`tests/runtime/lua_debug_poc_test/harness_types.rs`) and expanded to the
//! design's richer command/event vocabulary. They are reused across the debug
//! submodules (`session`, `inspect`, `breakpoints`, `hook`, `transport`,
//! `dap`) and form the seam between the VM-thread hook loop and the transport
//! thread.
//!
//! # Channel-seam invariant
//!
//! [`SessionCommand`] and [`SessionEvent`] cross a `std::sync::mpsc` channel
//! between the controller/transport and the VM-thread session loop. Every
//! payload here is therefore `Send`: all fields are `String` / `u32` / `usize`
//! / `Vec` / plain enums, with no raw pointers and no `mlua` handles.
//!
//! Crucially, `mlua::Error` is `!Send`; the [`SessionEvent::Error`] variant
//! carries the *stringified* error so VM/FFI failures can cross the thread
//! boundary (design "Invariants": never pass `mlua::Lua`/`mlua::Error` across
//! the channel — commands and events only).
//!
//! These are pure DTOs. Behavioural state machines (`RunMode`, `StepKind`,
//! `StepController`) live in `session.rs`, not here.

/// # Why two tiers
///
/// VSCode's `setBreakpoints` is authoritative **per presented source**: one
/// request replaces every breakpoint for that source. But the runtime hook only
/// sees the executing `.lua` chunk + line. A single presented `.pasta` line can
/// resolve to MANY `.lua` lines (requirement 8.2), and a `.pasta`-origin BP and
/// a `.lua`-origin BP can resolve into the SAME chunk. Storing only the
/// execution coordinate would let a `setBreakpoints` for one presented source
/// evict another presented source's BP that happens to share a chunk. Splitting
/// the key fixes this:
///
/// - [`present_source`](Self::present_source) is the **retain / replace key**:
///   `set_breakpoints` drops and re-inserts only the entries whose
///   `present_source` matches the request's source (the DAP per-source
///   authoritative model). BPs presented under a *different* source survive even
///   if they resolve into the same chunk (requirement 4.4 — registered BPs
///   persist; requirement 8.2 — no cross-source eviction).
/// - `(chunk, lua_line)` is the **stop-decision key**: the hook reports the
///   executing chunk source + line, and [`should_pause`] matches against these
///   two fields. The presented space (`present_source`) is irrelevant to the
///   stop decision, so `.pasta`-presented and `.lua`-presented BPs in the same
///   chunk both fire independently.
///
/// For the existing `.lua` path these collapse to the same identity: the IDE
/// presents a `.lua` source path, `present_source` is that path, and `chunk`
